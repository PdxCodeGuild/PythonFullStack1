"""
Don't edit this part of the file, it is a Module Documentation string!

Define a function named knights() that returns a string to make the doctest pass.

Here is the test. it is indicated on the next line by the `>>>`:

>>> knights()
'Knights who say Ni!'

The line above is an assertion that when kinghts() is called, it will in fact
return the string 'Knights who say Ni!'

To run the test open your command line and enter:
`python -m doctest knights.py`
"""

# Write your function here.
def knights():
    print('Knights who say Ni!')
