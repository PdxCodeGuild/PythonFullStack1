    "> The user interface _is_ the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is a quote from [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-user-interface-is-the-application/), one of the creators of our good friend, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "His point is that in many ways it doesn’t matter how elegant and efficient the code underlying a website or application is. If the UI is crappy or ill-conceived, users will not (want to) use it. To the user, the interface is what they see, what they interact with. To users, the interface _is_ the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a website, the people who create the UI are [frontend developers](http://www.frontendhandbook.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: Frontend, front-end, front end…all of these are accepted spellings according to the people who write dictionaries for a living._\n",

    "## Our Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "As frontend developers, we build user experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Think of the coolest, most mind-blowing websites you’ve seen. There are great frontend developers behind every one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "HyperText Markup Language is the basis for all web pages. This tag-based language provides structure and meaning to content delivered over the web. HTML is where most of the accessibility hooks on a web page reside.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "Cascading Style Sheets is used to implement style and design. Its capabilities are vast, but its semantics can be confusing. We will focus on the major concepts, then get familiar with some tools to make building great websites dead simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript (_not_ [Javascript](http://javascriptnotjavascript.com/)) is the _lingua franca_ of the web. It’s possible to build complex web applications entirely using JavaScript, from the backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) to the frontend (React, Angular, Ember). For purposes of this course, we will be using JavaScript to [enhance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) our web pages with behaviors that improve the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "We work in the browser. Lucky for us, these days great tools are built in to most modern browsers for viewing the source code behind web pages, debugging CSS and JavaScript, measuring performance, and otherwise understanding what’s happening on the pages you build.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right click on this page. Choose “Inspect”. This is the web inspector. [Get to know it.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) It’s your new best friend.\n",

    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Responsibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Users have higher expectations than ever of how websites will behave. Think of the good and bad experiences you’ve had on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, have you ever tried to buy something on a website and come away with the impression that the company didn’t actually _want_ your money?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine trying to complete that same flow if you were couldn’t see or had limited use of your hands or were red/green color blind.\n",
    "\n",
    "As frontend developers, we have the power to create great user experiences. I believe we have a responsibility to do so as well.\n"

    "\n",
    "TBL made a decision when he invented HTML that it should be “permissive”. He wanted there to be as little friction as possible for people to be able to publish their content, so he intentionally made the language less strict than it could have been. This design decision seems to have paid off.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML being a permissive language is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it means your content is likely to be at least mostly usable/readable even if your markup is not perfect. On the other hand, it can be harder to find and fix problems in your markup because they won’t always show up as errors when you view your pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Many errors in HTML are the result of one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forgetting the ending tag (e.g., leaving off `</a>`)\n",
    "- A missing `\"` on an attribute value (e.g., `<a href=\"foo>foo</a>`)\n",
    "- A missing `<` or `>` on a tag (e.g., `<tr><td</td></tr>`)\n",
    "- Incorrectly nested tags (e.g., `<em><strong></em></strong>`)\n",
    "\n",
    "It can feel like you need eagle eyes to spot these kinds of mistakes! Luckily, the following are a couple of simple ways you can identify most of them pretty quickly:\n",

    "\n",
    "Every device on the internet is assigned a unique identifier, known as an IP (Internet Protocol) address. When you enter “google.com” into your web browser, that name gets translated to an [IP address](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1696588) by specialized servers called [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (Domain Name System) servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IP addresses you’re probably familir with look like `216.58.193.110` (that’s the IP address for google.com, by the way), where each number ranges from 0 to 255, for a total of 4,294,967,296 possible IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "These days, there are so many connected devices in the world that 4.2 billion addresses isn’t enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet is in the process of switching over to a new standard called IPv6 (the old one was IPv4). IPv6 addresses look like `2001:4860:4860::8888` (that’s the IPv6 address of one of [Google’s public DNS servers](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/)). The new format allows for a total of 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 unique addresses. (That’s 340 [undecillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_large_numbers), in case you’re curious.)\n",

    "## The Web\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat after me: **The web is not the internet.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The web is one of many applications that sit on the internet infrastructure. Email is another. FTP, SSH, VPN, and countless other services are others. In the words of former U.S. Senator, Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), [the internet is a series of tubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cZC67wXUTs). The web is just one thing that flows through these tubes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web consists of resources (text, images, audio, video) on servers that are reachable via [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator). If you want to go deeper, read up about [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol). The gist is that HTTP allows for [stateless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol) request/response interactions between clients (usually web browsers) and servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Web Browsers\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple’s Safari, Opera, Firefox, these are all examples of web browsers. The job of a web browser is to **make requests** to web servers and **display the results.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to just a few years ago, the various web browsers were super inconsistent in how they did this. The situation is better now, but there are still corners of the internet where these inconsistencies raise their ugly head (e.g., HTML emails).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Web Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "Web servers are just computers, connected to the internet, that understand requests from web browsers (and other HTTP clients) and know how to respond appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [approximately 1 billion websites](http://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/) online. Some servers serve many websites (sometimes called “shared hosting”) and some websites (e.g., www.facebook.com and www.google.com) are powered by 100s of 1000s of servers. The number of web servers in the world is likely on the order of 1 order of magnitude less than the number of sites, but don’t quote me on that.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every one of us has at some point typed `www.google.com` into our browser’s address bar and hit enter. How many of us know what actually happens next?\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s actually happening under the hood is that the web browser first resolves the URL to an IP address, then crafts a complex string of text to send to the web server. \n",
    "\n",
    "This string of text is called an [HTTP packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_message_body) and it consists mostly of [headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) related to the request, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether it’s a secure request or not (`http` vs. `https`)\n",
    "- The location of the resource being requested (e.g., if the URL entered is `http://example.com/search?q=lolcat`, the location would be `/search?q=lolcat`)\n",
    "- The kind of request (e.g., `GET` or `POST` [we’ll cover this more in a future lesson])\n",
    "- What [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) of response the client is capable of accepting, including file types and acceptable compression schemes\n",
    "- The preferred language (e.g., U.S. English) of the response\n",
    "- Any [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) for the domain entered\n",
    "- An optional body of content (used usually in conjunction with `POST` requests)\n",
    "- The [user agent string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) (a string of text that is supposed to help the web server identify what browser is being used to make the response, but is so easily spoofable and so often misused that it’s basically worthless)\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you have any idea so much went into those visits to [dilbert.com](http://www.dilbert.com)?\n",
    "\n",
    "To be fair, all of the above isn’t strictly required to make an [HTTP request](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6686261).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a Web Response\n",
    "\n",
    "Web servers respond to correctly formatted requests with the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An [HTTP status code](https://http.cat/) (there are a bunch of these, but some of the common ones are `200` for a successful response, `404` for a missing resource, and `500` for a server error)\n",
    "- Response headers, including the version of HTTP being served (`1.0` or `1.1`) the content [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type), the date and time of the response, and other optional information such as whether the response was served from cache\n",
    "- The body of the response (this is usually the content that we’re most interested in)\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of the response can be text (e.g., HTML), an image, video, audio, or anything else that can be transmitted as 1s and 0s across wires and airwaves.\n",

    "\n",
    "## How Tags Work\n",
    "\n",
    "[HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) describes a set of “tags” that can be used to add [semantic infromation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML) to the content of web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <h1>My Headline</h1>\n",
    "    <p>This is my <em>awesome</em> paragraph of text.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `<h1></h1>` is a **header** tag. The text, `My Headline`, is the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, `<p></p>` is a **paragraph** tag. The text, `This is my awesome paragraph of text.`, is the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<em></em>` tag adds **emphasis** to the word “awesome” in our sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most tags (with a few exceptions) are structured like this, with an **opening** and **closing** tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "In HTML documents, web browsers treat any number of consecutive whitespace characters (i.e. spaces, newlines, and tabs) as a single space. Because of this behavior, if we took out the tags around the content above, it would render like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    My Headline This is my awesome paragraph of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s the tags that tell the browser to render our example like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "# My Headline\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my _awesome_ paragraph of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moar Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML provides tags for a host of common semantics. These give the content structure and meaning. Always try to [find and use a semantic tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) if one is available for what you’re trying to convey.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML describes 6 levels of headers (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, … `<h6>`). This number of headers is a remnant from the original use case of scientific papers, but it’s adequate for most situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <h1>My Headline</h1>\n",
    "    <h2>My Sub-Headline</h2>    \n",

    "\n",

    "Similar to Python, you can add comments to HTML code. HTML comments are structured like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- this is a comment -->\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <!-- this is a \n",
    "         multi-line comment -->\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content structure\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few tags you can use to describe your content’s high-level structure. These typically don’t add much in the way of styling information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- self-contained piece of the document -->\n",
    "    <article></article>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- container for a section of content -->\n",
    "    <section></section>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- generic container for content -->\n",
    "    <div></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the above has an intended use, but in practice these tags can often be used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML provides specific tags for common semantics related to headers, navigation, and footers on a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <header>\n",
    "        <h1>My Page’s Header</h1>\n",
    "        <nav>\n",
    "            <!-- nav links go here -->\n",
    "        </nav>\n",
    "    </header>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <footer>\n",
    "        <p>My page’s footer.</p>\n",
    "    </footer>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the following tags describe sub-sets of the content:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- content tangential to main content -->\n",
    "    <aside></aside>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- container for an image, diagram, or code snippet\n",
    "         usually with a caption -->\n",
    "    <figure></figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting all of these together, the content for a page might be structured something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <article>\n",
    "        <header>\n",
    "            <h1>My Page’s Header</h1>\n",
    "            <nav>\n",
    "                <ul>\n",
    "                    <li><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li>\n",
    "                    <li><a href=\"/about\">About</a></li>\n",
    "                    <li><a href=\"/contact\">Contact Us</a></li>\n",
    "                </ul>\n",
    "            </nav>\n",
    "        </header>\n",
    "        <section>\n",
    "            <h1>Section 1 Header</h1>\n",
    "            <aside>\n",
    "                <p>Something tangential</p>\n",
    "            </aside>\n",
    "            <p>Some content</p>\n",
    "        </section>\n",
    "        <section>\n",
    "            <h1>Section 2 Header</h1>\n",
    "            <figure>\n",
    "                <img src=\"diagram.png\" alt=\"Diagram showing something important\">\n",

    "# Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how I said that the web was invented to help scientists share information? A big part of what scientists share is their research results and a big part of that is giant, boring tables of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, HTML has tags that can be used to describe giant, boring tables of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhere along the line, before CSS was really a thing, people decided to use tables to give web pages fancy layouts. Thankfully, those days are behind us and tables are, again, relegated to displaying tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables are basically like spreadsheets. They consist of rows and columns and cells. You can designate cells as headers. You can also merge cells across rows or columns (but not both at once!).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "It all starts, unsurprisingly, with the `<table></table>` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<table></table>` tag is not a direct container for content. There are a few tags that are legal to put inside the `<table></table>` tag, but we’re going to keep it simple and focus first on the tag for a row: `<tr></tr>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<tr></tr>` is also not a direct container for content. That job is left to table cells. Table cells are, in fact, the only tags that are allowed to be the direct descendents of the `<tr></tr>` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of table cells, headers cells and non-header cells. Header cells are designated using the `<th></th>` tag. Non-header cells are designated using the `<td></td>` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <table>\n",
    "        <tr>\n",
    "            <th>I am a header</th>\n",
    "            <td>I am not a header</td>\n",
    "        </tr>\n",
    "    </table>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is a super simple table consisting of one row and two cells, one of which is a header.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add more rows and more cells, but we need to keep the grid consistent. That is, if one row has X number of cells, all rows should have that same number of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <table>\n",
    "        <tr>\n",
    "            <th>I am a header</th>\n",
    "            <td>I am not a header</td>\n",
    "            <td>I am a 3rd column</td>\n",
    "        </tr>\n",
    "        <tr>\n",
    "            <th>I am a header in the 2nd row</th>\n",
    "            <td>I am not a header in the 2nd row</td>\n",
    "        </tr>\n",
    "    </table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Better example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <table>\n",
    "        <tr>\n",
    "            <th>I am a header</th>\n",
    "            <td>I am not a header</td>\n",
    "            <td>I am a 3rd column</td>\n",
    "        </tr>\n",
    "        <tr>\n",
    "            <th>I am a header in the 2nd row</th>\n",
    "            <td>I am not a header in the 2nd row</td>\n",
    "            <td>I am a 3rd column in the 2nd row</td>\n",
    "        </tr>\n",
    "    </table>\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "There is more you can do with tables, but not everyone is going to need [all of that functionality](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table), so I’ll leave that bit of exploration up to you.\n"
